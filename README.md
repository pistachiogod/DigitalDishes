# Recipe Analysis Project 🍽️

# 📜 Introduction
Dive into a savory dataset of online recipes, exploring unique culinary styles and traditions across various platforms. This project munches through a Kaggle dataset, focusing on attributes like recipe title, ingredients, preparation directions, and more, while omitting a few for a streamlined study.

# 🎯 Objective
The main dish here is to use logistic regression to predict a recipe's website of origin, exploring if websites have a unique flavor in crafting their recipes and using OpenAI with Langchain and Streamlit for awesome data visualization.

# 🛠️ Tech Stack
Langchain & Streamlit: For a dash of dynamic querying and data visualization.
OpenAI: To spice things up with enhanced capabilities for data interaction.

# The Files
### digitaldishes_analysis
This is an analysis of the dataset using jupyter notebook
### main.py
This is the code implementing Langchain, Streamlit, and OpenAI to visualize a dashboard. Photos of the output are provided

# 🚀 Implementation
Cooked up in Visual Studio, this project uses Langchain, Streamlit, and OpenAI to create a dashboard that allows dynamic queries about the dataset. With an easy, website-like dashboard, you can upload a CSV, verify its presence, and utilize an OpenAI agent for data analysis and user interaction through a question box.

# 📊 Analysis & Output
Despite “chopped” not being an ingredient, it emerged as a frequently used word. The functionality allows you to ask the dataset questions using ChatGPT, providing answers related to the given data. Note: There’s a 200MB file limit, so only 5% of the data (about 111,557 rows) was used.

# 📈 Results
Logistic regression accuracy: 0.57 (predicts the correct website 57% of the time)
Wordcloud insights: Salt, pepper, oil, and cheese are top ingredients, with "optional" being a common theme.
# 🍔 Fun Find
Got chicken and tortillas? BBQ Chicken Quesadilla is on the menu!

# 🔄 Conclusion
A tasty exploration through over 2 million rows of recipe data, revealing intriguing insights into ingredient usage and website prediction accuracy. A delightful journey for any data chef!
